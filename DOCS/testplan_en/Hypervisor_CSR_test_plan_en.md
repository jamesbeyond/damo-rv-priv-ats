# Hypervisor CSR Test Plan (Hypervisor_CSR Subset)

> This document is split from the original Hypervisor comprehensive test plan (Hypervisor_test_plan_en.md, now removed). Test case IDs remain unchanged; Group numbers are re-sequenced within this subset.
> Sibling subsets: [Hypervisor_Interrupts_test_plan_en.md](Hypervisor_Interrupts_test_plan_en.md) | [Hypervisor_Exceptions_test_plan_en.md](Hypervisor_Exceptions_test_plan_en.md)

## Overview

This test plan covers the register behavior of Hypervisor CSRs and Virtual Supervisor CSRs in the RISC-V Hypervisor (H) extension, including the CSR substitution mechanism, field WARL/WLRL constraints, environment configuration, and time offset functionality. Interrupt delivery/delegation mechanisms and exception/trap behavior are covered by the sibling subsets respectively.

This test plan is written based on specification points (norm tags) in the official RISC-V SPEC:

- Local path: `SPEC/riscv-isa-manual/src/priv/hypervisor.adoc` (H/VS CSR body, vstimecmp/STCE/VSTIP related)
- Official repository: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual (files at the above paths within the repository)
- Specification points for the STCE/PBMTE/ADUE/CBZE/CBIE/CBCFE/PMM/LPE/SSE/DTE fields of `henvcfg` are recorded in the normative rule defs of `hypervisor.adoc` (referencing the conditional semantics of extensions such as Sstc/Svpbmt/Svadu/Zicbom/Zicboz/Ssnpm/Zicfilp/Zicfiss/Ssdbltrp)
- If any platform violates the SPEC, the corresponding test cases remain FAIL and are recorded in the `bugs/` directory

## Covered Specification Points

This section lists all specification points (norm IDs) referenced in Groups 1-9 of this document, deduplicated and sorted alphabetically.

| Norm ID | English Description |
|---------|---------------------|
| `norm:H_mtval_nrz` | CSR `mtval` must not be read-only zero. |
| `norm:hedeleg_acc` | Each bit of `hedeleg` shall be either writable or read-only zero. Many bits of `hedeleg` are required specifically to be writable or zero, as enumerated in the table. Bit 0, corresponding to instruction address-misaligned exceptions, must be writable if IALIGN=32. |
| `norm:hedeleg_sz_acc` | Register `hedeleg` is a 64-bit read/write register. |
| `norm:henvcfg_adue_op` | If the Svadu extension is implemented, the ADUE bit controls whether hardware updating of PTE A/D bits is enabled for VS-stage address translation. When ADUE=1, hardware updating is enabled. When ADUE=0, the implementation behaves as though Svade were implemented for VS-stage address translation. If Svadu is not implemented, ADUE is read-only zero. |
| `norm:henvcfg_cbcfe` | The Zicbom extension adds the CBCFE field to `henvcfg`. When V=1, if CBO.CLEAN and CBO.FLUSH are HS-qualified and CBCFE=1, they are enabled; if CBCFE=0, they raise a virtual-instruction exception. When Zicbom is not implemented, CBCFE is read-only zero. |
| `norm:henvcfg_cbie` | The Zicbom extension adds the CBIE WARL field to `henvcfg`. The CBIE field controls execution of CBO.INVAL in privilege modes VS and VU. The encoding `10b` is reserved. When Zicbom is not implemented, CBIE is read-only zero. |
| `norm:henvcfg_cbze` | The Zicboz extension adds the CBZE field to `henvcfg`. When CBZE=1, CBO.ZERO is enabled for execution in VS/VU mode; when CBZE=0, it raises a virtual-instruction exception. When the Zicboz extension is not implemented, CBZE is read-only zero. |
| `norm:henvcfg_dte_op` | The Ssdbltrp extension adds the double-trap-enable (DTE) field in `henvcfg`. When `henvcfg`.DTE is zero, the implementation behaves as though Ssdbltrp is not implemented for VS-mode and the `vsstatus`.SDT bit is read-only zero. |
| `norm:henvcfg_fiom_op` | If bit FIOM is set to one in `henvcfg`, FENCE instructions executed when V=1 are modified so the requirement to order accesses to device I/O implies also the requirement to order main memory accesses. |
| `norm:henvcfg_fiom_order` | Similarly, when FIOM=1 and V=1, if an atomic instruction that accesses a region ordered as device I/O has its _aq_ and/or _rl_ bit set, then that instruction is ordered as though it accesses both device I/O and memory. |
| `norm:henvcfg_lpe_op` | The Zicfilp extension adds the LPE field in `henvcfg`. When LPE=1, the Zicfilp extension is enabled in VS-mode. When LPE=0, the hart does not update the ELP state and LPAD operates as a no-op. |
| `norm:henvcfg_pbmte_op` | The PBMTE bit controls whether the Svpbmt extension is available for use in VS-stage address translation. When PBMTE=1, Svpbmt is available for VS-stage address translation. When PBMTE=0, the implementation behaves as though Svpbmt were not implemented for VS-stage address translation. If Svpbmt is not implemented, PBMTE is read-only zero. |
| `norm:henvcfg_pmm_op` | If the Ssnpm extension is implemented, the PMM field enables or disables pointer masking for VS-mode. When not implemented, PMM is read-only zero. PMM is read-only zero for RV32. |
| `norm:henvcfg_sse_op` | The Zicfiss extension adds the SSE field in `henvcfg`. If SSE=1, the Zicfiss extension is activated in VS-mode. When SSE=0, the extension remains inactive in VS-mode with specific behavior changes. |
| `norm:henvcfg_stce` | The Sstc extension adds the STCE (STimecmp Enable) bit to `henvcfg` CSR. When the Sstc extension is not implemented, STCE is read-only zero. The STCE bit enables `vstimecmp` for VS-mode when set to one. When STCE is zero, an attempt to access `stimecmp` (really `vstimecmp`) when V=1 raises a virtual-instruction exception, and VSTIP in `hip` reverts to its defined behavior as if this extension is not implemented. |
| `norm:henvcfg_sz_acc_op` | The `henvcfg` CSR is a 64-bit read/write register that controls certain characteristics of the execution environment when virtualization mode V=1. |
| `norm:hideleg_acc` | Among bits 15:0 of `hideleg`, bits 10, 6, and 2 (corresponding to the standard VS-level interrupts) are writable, and bits 12, 9, 5, and 1 (corresponding to the standard S-level interrupts) are read-only zeros. |
| `norm:hideleg_sz_acc` | Register `hideleg` is an HSXLEN-bit read/write register. |
| `norm:hip_vstip_clear` | If the result of this comparison changes, it is guaranteed to be reflected in VSTIP eventually, but not necessarily immediately. The interrupt remains posted until `vstimecmp` becomes greater than (`time` + `htimedelta`), typically as a result of writing `vstimecmp`. |
| `norm:hip_vstip_enable` | The interrupt will be taken based on the standard interrupt enable and delegation rules while V=1. |
| `norm:hip_vstip_op` | A virtual supervisor timer interrupt becomes pending, as reflected in the VSTIP bit in the `hip` register, whenever (`time` + `htimedelta`), truncated to 64 bits, contains a value greater than or equal to `vstimecmp`, treating the values as unsigned integers. |
| `norm:H_scsrs_nomatch` | Some standard supervisor CSRs (`senvcfg`, `scounteren`, and `scontext`, possibly others) have no matching VS CSR. These supervisor CSRs continue to have their usual function and accessibility even when V=1, except with VS-mode and VU-mode substituting for HS-mode and U-mode. |
| `norm:H_vscsrs_acc_m_hs` | The VS CSRs can be accessed as themselves only from M-mode or HS-mode. |
| `norm:H_vscsrs_acc_u` | Attempts from U-mode cause an illegal-instruction exception as usual. |
| `norm:H_vscsrs_acc_vs` | When V=1, an attempt to read or write a VS CSR directly by its own separate CSR address causes a virtual-instruction exception. |
| `norm:H_vscsrs_sub` | When V=1, the VS CSRs substitute for the corresponding supervisor CSRs, taking over all functions of the usual supervisor CSRs except as specified otherwise. Instructions that normally read or modify a supervisor CSR shall instead access the corresponding VS CSR. |
| `norm:H_vscsrs_v0` | When V=0, the VS CSRs do not ordinarily affect the behavior of the machine other than being readable and writable by CSR instructions. |
| `norm:H_vscsrs_v1` | While V=1, the normal HS-level supervisor CSRs that are replaced by VS CSRs retain their values but do not affect the behavior of the machine unless specifically documented to do so. |
| `norm:hstatus_gva_op` | Field GVA (Guest Virtual Address) is written by the implementation whenever a trap is taken into HS-mode. For any trap that writes a guest virtual address to `stval`, GVA is set to 1. For any other trap into HS-mode, GVA is set to 0. |
| `norm:hstatus_hu_op` | Field HU (Hypervisor in U-mode) controls whether the virtual-machine load/store instructions, HLV, HLVX, and HSV, can be used also in U-mode. When HU=1, these instructions can be executed in U-mode the same as in HS-mode. When HU=0, all hypervisor instructions cause an illegal-instruction exception in U-mode. |
| `norm:hstatus_spv_op` | The SPV bit (Supervisor Previous Virtualization mode) is written by the implementation whenever a trap is taken into HS-mode. Just as the SPP bit in `sstatus` is set to the (nominal) privilege mode at the time of the trap, the SPV bit in `hstatus` is set to the value of the virtualization mode V at the time of the trap. |
| `norm:hstatus_spv_sret` | When an SRET instruction is executed when V=0, V is set to SPV. |
| `norm:hstatus_spvp_op` | When V=1 and a trap is taken into HS-mode, bit SPVP (Supervisor Previous Virtual Privilege) is set to the nominal privilege mode at the time of the trap, the same as `sstatus`.SPP. But if V=0 before a trap, SPVP is left unchanged on trap entry. |
| `norm:hstatus_sz_acc_op` | The `hstatus` register is an HSXLEN-bit read/write register... provides facilities analogous to the `mstatus` register for tracking and controlling the exception behavior of a VS-mode guest. |
| `norm:hstatus_vgein_op` | The VGEIN (Virtual Guest External Interrupt Number) field selects a guest external interrupt source for VS-level external interrupts. VGEIN is a WLRL field that must be able to hold values between zero and the maximum guest external interrupt number (known as GEILEN), inclusive. |
| `norm:hstatus_vsbe_op` | The VSBE bit is a WARL field that controls the endianness of explicit memory accesses made from VS-mode. |
| `norm:hstatus_vsxl_32` | When HSXLEN=32, the VSXL field does not exist, and VSXLEN=32. |
| `norm:hstatus_vsxl_64` | When HSXLEN=64, VSXL is a WARL field that is encoded the same as the MXL field of `misa`. |
| `norm:hstatus_vsxl_op` | The VSXL field controls the effective XLEN for VS-mode (known as VSXLEN), which may differ from the XLEN for HS-mode (HSXLEN). |
| `norm:hstatus_vtsr_op` | When VTSR=1, an attempt in VS-mode to execute SRET raises a virtual-instruction exception. |
| `norm:hstatus_vtvm_op` | When VTVM=1, an attempt in VS-mode to execute SFENCE.VMA or SINVAL.VMA or to access CSR `satp` raises a virtual-instruction exception. |
| `norm:hstatus_vtw_op` | When VTW=1 (and assuming `mstatus`.TW=0), an attempt in VS-mode to execute WFI raises a virtual-instruction exception if the WFI does not complete within an implementation-specific, bounded time limit. |
| `norm:htimedelta_sz_acc_op` | The `htimedelta` CSR is a 64-bit read/write register that contains the delta between the value of the `time` CSR and the value returned in VS-mode or VU-mode. Reading the `time` CSR in VS or VU mode returns the sum of `htimedelta` and the actual value of `time`. |
| `norm:time_htimedelta_req` | If the `time` CSR is implemented, `htimedelta` (and `htimedeltah` for XLEN=32) must be implemented. |
| `norm:vscause_sz_acc_op` | The `vscause` register is a VSXLEN-bit read/write register that is VS-mode's version of supervisor register `scause`. When V=1, `vscause` substitutes for the usual `scause`. When V=0, `vscause` does not directly affect the behavior of the machine. |
| `norm:vscause_wlrl` | `vscause` is a WLRL register that must be able to hold the same set of values that `scause` can hold. |
| `norm:vsepc_warl` | `vsepc` is a WARL register that must be able to hold the same set of values that `sepc` can hold. |
| `norm:vsip_vsie_lcofi` | Extension Shlcofideleg supports delegating LCOFI interrupts to VS-mode. If implemented, `hideleg` bit 13 is writable; otherwise read-only zero. When bit 13 of `hideleg` is zero, `vsip`.LCOFIP and `vsie`.LCOFIE are read-only zeros. Else, they are aliases of `sip`.LCOFIP and `sie`.LCOFIE. |
| `norm:vsip_vsie_sei` | When bit 10 of `hideleg` is zero, `vsip`.SEIP and `vsie`.SEIE are read-only zeros. Else, they are aliases of `hip`.VSEIP and `hie`.VSEIE. |
| `norm:vsip_vsie_ssi` | When bit 2 of `hideleg` is zero, `vsip`.SSIP and `vsie`.SSIE are read-only zeros. Else, they are aliases of `hip`.VSSIP and `hie`.VSSIE. |
| `norm:vsip_vsie_sti` | When bit 6 of `hideleg` is zero, `vsip`.STIP and `vsie`.STIE are read-only zeros. Else, they are aliases of `hip`.VSTIP and `hie`.VSTIE. |
| `norm:vsip_vsie_sz_acc_op` | The `vsip` and `vsie` registers are VSXLEN-bit read/write registers that are VS-mode's versions of supervisor CSRs `sip` and `sie`. When V=1, `vsip` and `vsie` substitute for the usual `sip` and `sie`. However, interrupts directed to HS-level continue to be indicated in the HS-level `sip` register, not in `vsip`, when V=1. |
| `norm:vspec_sz_acc_op` | The `vsepc` register is a VSXLEN-bit read/write register that is VS-mode's version of supervisor register `sepc`. When V=1, `vsepc` substitutes for the usual `sepc`. When V=0, `vsepc` does not directly affect the behavior of the machine. |
| `norm:vsscratch_sz_acc_op` | The `vsscratch` register is a VSXLEN-bit read/write register that is VS-mode's version of supervisor register `sscratch`. When V=1, `vsscratch` substitutes for the usual `sscratch`. The contents of `vsscratch` never directly affect the behavior of the machine. |
| `norm:vsstatus_fs_op` | When V=1, both `vsstatus`.FS and the HS-level `sstatus`.FS are in effect. Attempts to execute a floating-point instruction when either field is 0 (Off) raise an illegal-instruction exception. Modifying the floating-point state when V=1 causes both fields to be set to 3 (Dirty). |
| `norm:vsstatus_sd_xs_op` | Read-only fields SD and XS summarize the extension context status as it is visible to VS-mode only. For example, the value of the HS-level `sstatus`.FS does not affect `vsstatus`.SD. |
| `norm:vsstatus_sz_acc_op` | The `vsstatus` register is a VSXLEN-bit read/write register that is VS-mode's version of supervisor register `sstatus`. When V=1, `vsstatus` substitutes for the usual `sstatus`, so instructions that normally read or modify `sstatus` actually access `vsstatus` instead. |
| `norm:vsstatus_ube` | An implementation may make field UBE be a read-only copy of `hstatus`.VSBE. |
| `norm:vsstatus_uxl_change` | If VSXLEN is changed from 32 to a wider width, and if field UXL is not restricted to a single value, it gets the value corresponding to the widest supported width not wider than the new VSXLEN. |
| `norm:vsstatus_uxl_op` | The UXL field controls the effective XLEN for VU-mode. When VSXLEN=32, the UXL field does not exist, and VU-mode XLEN=32. When VSXLEN=64, UXL is a WARL field. An implementation may make UXL be a read-only copy of field VSXL of `hstatus`, forcing VU-mode XLEN=VSXLEN. |
| `norm:vsstatus_v0` | When V=0, `vsstatus` does not directly affect the behavior of the machine, unless a virtual-machine load/store (HLV, HLVX, or HSV) or the MPRV feature in the `mstatus` register is used to execute a load or store as though V=1. |
| `norm:vsstatus_vs_op` | Similarly, when V=1, both `vsstatus`.VS and the HS-level `sstatus`.VS are in effect. Attempts to execute a vector instruction when either field is 0 (Off) raise an illegal-instruction exception. Modifying the vector state when V=1 causes both fields to be set to 3 (Dirty). |
| `norm:vstimecmp_acc` | In RV32 only, accesses to the `vstimecmp` CSR access the low 32 bits, while accesses to the `vstimecmph` CSR access the high 32 bits of `vstimecmp`. |
| `norm:vstimecmp_sz` | The `vstimecmp` CSR is a 64-bit register and has 64-bit precision on all RV32 and RV64 systems. |
| `norm:vstval_sz_acc_op` | The `vstval` register is a VSXLEN-bit read/write register that is VS-mode's version of supervisor register `stval`. When V=1, `vstval` substitutes for the usual `stval`. When V=0, `vstval` does not directly affect the behavior of the machine. |
| `norm:vstval_warl` | `vstval` is a WARL register that must be able to hold the same set of values that `stval` can hold. |
| `norm:vsxl_ro` | In particular, an implementation may make VSXL be a read-only field whose value always ensures that VSXLEN=HSXLEN. |
| `norm:vtw_virtinstr` | An implementation may have WFI always raise a virtual-instruction exception in VS-mode when VTW=1 (and `mstatus`.TW=0), even if there are pending globally-disabled interrupts when the instruction is executed. |

## Group 1. CSR Substitution Mechanism when V=1

**Specification References**:
- `norm:H_vscsrs_sub`: When V=1, VS CSRs substitute for corresponding S CSRs; instructions accessing S CSRs actually access VS CSRs
- `norm:H_vscsrs_acc_vs`: When V=1, direct access to VS CSR by its own address triggers virtual-instruction exception
- `norm:H_vscsrs_acc_u`: U-mode access triggers illegal-instruction exception
- `norm:H_vscsrs_acc_m_hs`: VS CSRs can only be accessed by their own address in M/HS-mode
- `norm:H_vscsrs_v1`: When V=1, HS-level S CSRs retain values but do not affect behavior
- `norm:H_vscsrs_v0`: When V=0, VS CSRs do not affect behavior
- `norm:H_scsrs_nomatch`: Behavior of S CSRs without matching VS CSRs (senvcfg/scounteren/scontext) when V=1
- `norm:H_mtval_nrz`: mtval must not be read-only zero when the H extension is implemented (VCSR-18)

**Test Responsibilities**: Verify VS CSR substitution, access control, and isolation behavior in both V=1 and V=0 modes.

Among them, `norm:hstatus_vsxl_32`, `norm:vsstatus_uxl_change`, and `norm:vstimecmp_acc` are conditional specification points (depending on HSXLEN=32, the VSXLEN 32→64 switch, and the RV32 split-access scenario respectively); the corresponding branches are not triggered on RV64 platforms, and only WARL read-back verification is performed within the corresponding basic read/write cases. HENV-18/19 and HENV-24~29 are conditional cases (depending on the read-only-zero semantics when the corresponding extension is not implemented); VSIE-21/22 are conditional cases (depending on the Shlcofideleg probing result).
